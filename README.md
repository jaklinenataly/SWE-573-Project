# BlooderHood-App

SWE 573-Software Development Practise is taught by Dr.Suzan Üsküdarlı at Bogazici University.

The idea for creating Wiki is to give more informations and requirements about the project being prepared. Also, the weekly effort and time schedule regarding the project will take place under Wiki Page. After some investigations, the project idea is decided to be related with blood donation. Also it is named as a BlooderHood which gives an idea about the desired system to be.

The main idea of BlooderHood is; using the Twitter APIs to reach more people when blood donation is required. The system is expected to search for tweets and inform users when donation is required close to their location. By the help of the system more people can be informed and become donors.
